# alice_rs
Alice_rs is a small proof-of-concept reference implementation of a decision procedure for [A Decidable Fragment of Separation Logic](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/p.ohearn/papers/unroll_collapse_withproofs.pdf]).
The name comes from a wrong pronounciation of the ls structure. The correct pronounciation would be "list structure" but it could also be read as "alas structure" which sounds a bit like alice.
